# Mixing-by-cutting-and-shuffling
Code to investigate mixing by cutting and shuffling of a 1D line. Solving an iteratvie advection-diffion equation where stirring is performed by an Interval Exchange transformation and diffusion applied by solving the heat equation with peroidic boundary conditions. Used to produce the results published in PAPER.
